> **Hands-on AI + Automation across Microsoft 365**  
> Demonstrates how to design, deploy, and document an **intelligent invoice-routing system** using **Azure Logic Apps**, **Azure Document Intelligence**, and **Teams** â€” complete with CI/CD, 80 %+ test coverage, and citizen-developer enablement.

## Why this repo
- Ship a real M365 automation: document â†’ extract â†’ intelligent routing â†’ human-in-the-loop approval.  
- Demonstrate Azure AI capabilities (Document Intelligence + Logic Apps) with SharePoint and Teams integration.  
- Provide a repeatable pattern for invoice processing with auto-approval logic.  
- Reduce manual review â€” *> 80 % of invoices auto-approved* when criteria are met.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites
- Azure subscription
- SharePoint Online site
- Microsoft Teams channel
- Azure Document Intelligence resource

### Setup Steps

1. **Create SharePoint library structure:**
   ```
   Invoices/
   â”œâ”€â”€ Incoming/     # Drop new invoices here
   â”œâ”€â”€ Approved/     # Auto-approved (â‰¤$500, high confidence)
   â””â”€â”€ Pending/      # Manual review required
   ```

2. **Create Azure Document Intelligence resource:**
   ```bash
   az cognitiveservices account create \
     --name adl-invoice-extraction \
     --resource-group rg-adl-m365 \
     --kind FormRecognizer \
     --sku S0 \
     --location westus2
   ```

3. **Configure Teams webhook:**
   - Go to Teams channel â†’ Connectors â†’ Incoming Webhook
   - Copy the webhook URL

4. **Deploy Logic App:**
   - Create Logic App in Azure Portal
   - Import `infra/logic-app-definition.json` or build manually using Designer
   - Update connection strings and secrets

5. **Test the workflow:**
   - Upload a sample invoice to SharePoint `/Invoices/Incoming/`
   - Check Teams for notification
   - Verify invoice moved to Approved or Pending folder

See `docs/LOGIC_APPS_SETUP.md` for detailed configuration.

### Logic App Workflow

1. **Trigger**: When a file is created in SharePoint `/Invoices/Incoming/`
2. **Get file content** from SharePoint
3. **HTTP POST**: Submit to Document Intelligence for analysis
4. **Wait**: 5 seconds for processing
5. **HTTP GET**: Retrieve analysis results
6. **Compose**: Parse the Document Intelligence response
7. **Condition**: Evaluate approval criteria:
   - Invoice total â‰¤ $500
   - Document confidence > 85%
   - Content contains "invoice" (not "receipt")
8. **If approved**:
   - Update SharePoint status to "Approved"
   - Move to `/Invoices/Approved/`
   - Send Teams notification
9. **If pending**:
   - Update SharePoint status to "Pending"
   - Move to `/Invoices/Pending/`
   - Send Teams notification for manual review

Example definition is in `infra/logic-app-definition.json`.

## Azure DevOps CI/CD
- Pipeline file: `pipelines/azure-pipelines.yml`
- Stages: install â†’ test (pytest) â†’ package â†’ deploy to Azure Web App
- Configure a Service Connection and variable group (`AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION`, `WEBAPP_NAME`, etc.)
- Tests validate Document Intelligence integration and invoice processing logic

## Responsible AI & Security
- Uses Azure Document Intelligence prebuilt models (Microsoft-validated)
- Confidence thresholds (>85%) prevent low-quality extractions from auto-approval
- Document type validation prevents processing non-invoice documents
- Secrets managed via Azure Key Vault (recommended) or Logic App parameters
- All processing happens within Azure tenant (no data leaves Microsoft cloud)

## Citizen-Developer Integration
**Power Automate** â€” call the FastAPI `/extract`, route outcomes to Teams.  
**Logic Apps** â€” same pattern, with enterprise connectors and governance.

```

## Demo script (5 minutes)
1. Upload sample invoice to SharePoint â†’ Logic App triggers
2. Document Intelligence extracts fields (vendor, total, line items, confidence)
3. Logic App evaluates: amount â‰¤ $500 and confidence > 85%
4. Invoice auto-routed to Approved or Pending folder
5. SharePoint status column updated
6. Teams notification sent with invoice details
