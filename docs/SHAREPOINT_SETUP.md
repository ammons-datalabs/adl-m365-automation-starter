# SharePoint + Power Automate Setup Guide

This guide walks you through setting up the complete invoice automation workflow on SharePoint.

## Architecture

```
SharePoint "Invoices" Library
    â”œâ”€â”€ Incoming/        (drop invoices here)
    â”œâ”€â”€ Approved/        (AI auto-approved invoices)
    â””â”€â”€ Pending/         (awaiting human review in Teams)
```

## Part 1: SharePoint Setup

### 1. Create Document Library

1. Go to your SharePoint site
2. Click **"+ New"** â†’ **"Document library"**
3. Name: `Invoices`
4. Click **"Create"**

### 2. Create Folders

In the Invoices library, create three folders:
- Click **"+ New"** â†’ **"Folder"**
- Create: `Incoming`, `Approved`, `Pending`

### 3. Add Custom Columns (Optional but Recommended)

Add these columns to track invoice metadata:

1. Click **Settings** (gear icon) â†’ **Library settings**
2. Under "Columns", click **"Create column"** for each:
   - **Vendor** (Single line of text)
   - **InvoiceNumber** (Single line of text)
   - **InvoiceDate** (Date)
   - **Total** (Number, 2 decimals)
   - **Currency** (Single line of text)
   - **Confidence** (Number, 2 decimals)
   - **ApprovalType** (Choice: "AI Auto-Approved", "Human Approved", "Pending")
   - **ApprovalID** (Single line of text)

## Part 2: Power Automate Flow

### Create the Flow

1. Go to https://make.powerautomate.com
2. Click **"+ Create"** â†’ **"Automated cloud flow"**
3. Name: `Invoice Processing - Intelligent Routing`
4. Trigger: Search for **"When a file is created (properties only)"** (SharePoint)
5. Click **"Create"**

### Step-by-Step Flow Configuration

#### Step 1: Configure Trigger

**When a file is created (properties only)**
- **Site Address**: [Select your SharePoint site]
- **Library Name**: `Invoices`
- **Folder**: `/Incoming`
- **Include Nested Folders**: No

#### Step 2: Get File Content

Add action: **Get file content** (SharePoint)
- **Site Address**: [Same as trigger]
- **File Identifier**: `ID` (from dynamic content)

#### Step 3: Process Invoice with API

Add action: **HTTP**
- **Method**: `POST`
- **URI**:
  ```
  https://asp-adl-m365-us-baaydcahbudkeef8.westus3-01.azurewebsites.net/invoices/process?confidence_threshold=0.85
  ```
- **Headers**: Leave empty (Power Automate will handle Content-Type)
- **Body**: Click "Show advanced options"
  - Select **"Body"** field
  - Add dynamic content: **File Content** (from "Get file content")

**Advanced Settings:**
- **Asynchronous Pattern**: On
- **Timeout**: `PT2M` (2 minutes - Azure DI can be slow)

**Important**: Power Automate will automatically handle the multipart/form-data encoding when you use the File Content directly in the body.

#### Step 4: Parse JSON Response

Add action: **Parse JSON** (Data Operation)
- **Content**: `Body` (from HTTP action)
- **Schema**: Click "Use sample payload to generate schema" and paste:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "auto_approved",
    "message": "Invoice auto-approved (confidence: 100%)",
    "approval_id": "abc-123",
    "invoice_data": {
      "vendor": "CONTOSO LTD.",
      "invoice_number": "INV-100",
      "invoice_date": "11/15/2019",
      "total": 110.0,
      "currency": "USD",
      "confidence": 1.0
    }
  }
  ```

#### Step 5: Condition - Check Status

Add action: **Condition** (Control)
- **Value**: `status` (from Parse JSON)
- **Operator**: `is equal to`
- **Value**: `auto_approved`

#### Step 6a: If Auto-Approved (Yes Branch)

**Action 1: Move file to Approved folder**
- Add action: **Move file** (SharePoint)
- **Site Address**: [Same as before]
- **Current File Identifier**: `ID` (from trigger)
- **Destination Folder Path**: `/Invoices/Approved`
- **Name if file exists**: `Add number suffix`

**Action 2: Update file properties**
- Add action: **Update file properties** (SharePoint)
- **Site Address**: [Same]
- **Library Name**: `Invoices`
- **Id**: `ID` (from "Move file" action - use the new ID)
- **Title**: `invoice_number` (from Parse JSON)
- Fill in custom columns:
  - **Vendor**: `vendor`
  - **InvoiceNumber**: `invoice_number`
  - **InvoiceDate**: `invoice_date`
  - **Total**: `total`
  - **Currency**: `currency`
  - **Confidence**: `confidence`
  - **ApprovalType**: `AI Auto-Approved`
  - **ApprovalID**: `approval_id`

**Action 3: Send Teams notification**
- Add action: **Post message in a chat or channel** (Teams)
- **Post as**: `Flow bot`
- **Post in**: `Channel`
- **Team**: [Your team]
- **Channel**: [Your channel]
- **Message**:
  ```
  âœ… Invoice Auto-Approved by AI

  Vendor: @{body('Parse_JSON')?['invoice_data']?['vendor']}
  Invoice #: @{body('Parse_JSON')?['invoice_data']?['invoice_number']}
  Total: @{body('Parse_JSON')?['invoice_data']?['currency']} @{body('Parse_JSON')?['invoice_data']?['total']}
  Confidence: @{mul(body('Parse_JSON')?['invoice_data']?['confidence'], 100)}%

  File: @{triggerOutputs()?['body/{FilenameWithExtension}']}
  Location: Invoices/Approved
  ```

#### Step 6b: If Pending Approval (No Branch)

**Action 1: Move file to Pending folder**
- Add action: **Move file** (SharePoint)
- **Site Address**: [Same]
- **Current File Identifier**: `ID` (from trigger)
- **Destination Folder Path**: `/Invoices/Pending`

**Action 2: Update file properties**
- Add action: **Update file properties** (SharePoint)
- [Same as above but **ApprovalType**: `Pending Human Review`]

**Action 3: Send Teams notification**
- Add action: **Post message in a chat or channel** (Teams)
- **Message**:
  ```
  ðŸ“§ Invoice Requires Human Review

  Vendor: @{body('Parse_JSON')?['invoice_data']?['vendor']}
  Invoice #: @{body('Parse_JSON')?['invoice_data']?['invoice_number']}
  Total: @{body('Parse_JSON')?['invoice_data']?['currency']} @{body('Parse_JSON')?['invoice_data']?['total']}
  Confidence: @{mul(body('Parse_JSON')?['invoice_data']?['confidence'], 100)}% (below threshold)

  ðŸ“‹ An approval card has been sent to Teams.
  Check your Teams channel for the approval request.
  ```

### Step 7: Save and Test

1. Click **"Save"** (top right)
2. Name your flow if prompted
3. Click **"Test"** â†’ **"Manually"**
4. Upload a test PDF to the `Invoices/Incoming` folder
5. Watch the flow run!

## Part 3: Testing

### Test 1: High Confidence Invoice (Should Auto-Approve)

1. Download sample invoice:
   ```bash
   curl -o test-invoice.pdf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-REST-api-samples/master/curl/form-recognizer/sample-invoice.pdf
   ```

2. Upload to `Invoices/Incoming` folder

3. Expected:
   - Flow triggers
   - API processes (100% confidence)
   - File moves to `Approved`
   - Teams notification sent
   - Metadata updated

### Test 2: Low Confidence (Should Go to Teams)

For this, you need a lower-quality invoice. You can:
- Create a simple invoice in Word and save as PDF
- Use a photo of a handwritten receipt
- Adjust the threshold in the API call to force Teams routing

## Part 4: Monitoring

### View Flow Runs

1. Go to https://make.powerautomate.com
2. Click **"My flows"**
3. Click your flow
4. View **"28-day run history"**
5. Click any run to see detailed logs

### Common Issues

**Issue: Flow fails at HTTP step**
- **Solution**: Check API URL is correct and Azure app is running
- Test URL: `https://asp-adl-m365-us-baaydcahbudkeef8.westus3-01.azurewebsites.net/health`

**Issue: "File not found" error**
- **Solution**: Ensure file is fully uploaded before flow triggers
- Add a 5-second delay after trigger

**Issue: Multipart encoding error**
- **Solution**: Make sure you're using File Content directly in HTTP body
- Power Automate handles encoding automatically

**Issue: Timeout after 120 seconds**
- **Solution**: Azure DI can be slow. Increase timeout or use async pattern

## Part 5: Production Considerations

### Security
- Use Azure Key Vault for API credentials if needed
- Restrict SharePoint folder permissions
- Enable audit logging

### Performance
- Monitor Azure Application Insights
- Set up alerts for failures
- Consider batch processing for high volume

### Scaling
- Use parallel branches for multiple API calls
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Consider Azure Functions for complex workflows

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Set up SharePoint library and folders
2. âœ… Create Power Automate flow
3. âœ… Test with sample invoices
4. âœ… Configure Teams notifications
5. âœ… Set up monitoring and alerts
6. âœ… Train users on the system
7. âœ… Go live!
